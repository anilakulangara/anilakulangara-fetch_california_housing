# anilakulangara-fetch_california_housing

## Objective

#### The goal of this assignment is to apply regression techniques in supervised learning using the California Housing dataset. We will implement multiple regression algorithms, compare their performance, and determine the best model for predicting house prices.

## Dataset

#### The California Housing dataset from sklearn.datasets is used.

#### It contains various features of houses in California along with their median prices.

#### The dataset is loaded using fetch_california_housing and converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier handling.

## Preprocessing Steps

#### Handling Missing Values: Checked and handled any missing data (if present).

#### Feature Scaling: Standardized the features using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity.

#### Data Exploration: Performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions.

# Regression Models Implemented

### The following regression models are applied:

### .Linear Regression

### .Decision Tree Regressor

### .Random Forest Regressor

### .Gradient Boosting Regressor

### .Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

### For each model:

### A brief explanation of how it works is provided.

### The suitability of the model for this dataset is discussed.

## Model Evaluation

## Each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

### .Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### .Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### .RÂ² Score

### A comparison of all models is performed to:

### Identify the best-performing model with justification.

### Identify the worst-performing model with reasoning.
